A client must interact with the Collector according to the following rules:

  1. The client must initiate an encrypted, TLS1.2 or highter connection. The client's
     certificate is required to be signed by a specific CA.

  2. The client's message must include a preamble of the following format:
        PREAMBLE            ::= MONITOR_HOSTNAME\nTARGET_HOSTNAME\nTIMESTAMP\nNOTICE_METHOD\n
        MONITOR_HOSTNAME    ::= <FQDN of the Monitor>
        TARGET_HOSTNAME     ::= <FQDN of the target>
        TIMESTAMP           ::= <Unix Time of the MTR>
        NOTICE_METHOD       ::= "webhook" | "email" | "finish"

  3. At present, the client is expected to initiate its first connection with the "webhook"
     or "email" methods. These methods leave the test data on the server. The client can instruct
     the server to delete the data and its index by calling the "finish" method. Until the finish
     method is called, any tests for a target which has been tested previously will be added to
     to the existing collection.
        * The server will "age" tests such that they will be removed automatically
          after eg. 30 minutes.

  4. The client is NOT expected to hold open the TLS connection to send new instructions.

  5. The client is NOT expected to offer any authentication other than its certificate, nor to
     offer any authentication information to be used for the transmission of the collected tests.
